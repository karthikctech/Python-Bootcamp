            <h2>Our Certificate & Online Program For 2021 </h2>
            <p>I’m currently doing my final year in CEG and hence I believe I’m qualified to answer your question.

              First of all, You need to understand that CEG (College of Engineering, Guindy) is not Anna University. CEG comes as UD (University Department). So is MIT, AC TECH etc. So, next time, quote the correct requirement :)
              
          <br>    I’m writing this point in case you’re asking about CEG. I personally believe that getting a seat in CEG was the greatest gift, life has ever given for me.
              
          <br>    When comparing to the fee that you pay for education, the infrastructure they provide you is so good.
              The thing about staff is how you approach them. Most of our staffs will have a child near your age. So, whenever you approach a staff, either in person or confront in case of a difference in opinion before the entire class, deliver your thought with full respect and mainly not hurting their feelings. I’ve personally seen so much confrontations mainly because of this simple thing.
              The staffs, they’ll treat you so well. 
             <br> They will give you the respect you deserve(not like other colleges where you need to be terrified to stand before them). In my personal opinion, higher their grade, greater will be their treatment.
              Staff Quality - There were few scenarios where the staff is talented but cannot deliver them fully. Few exceptions do exists. But when you calculate it mathematically, it won’t cause a notable dent in the graph. But most of the staffs in Asst.  <br> Professor grade and any staff above it are truly knowledged people. In that few are even exceptional. A professor in my department just published his 1000th paper in computer science. There are people who have knowledge about the computers from 2nd Generation. So, sitting in a 60 hr lecture class with them for a semester is like a blessing for anyone who loves to learn everything about that paper. Even The dean will be roaming near knowledge park often. (With a ID tag in around your neck) you can approach him directly if you have a big issue.
              Training - Don’t expect the staffs to spoon feed you like your school did in 12th standard. This is a place where you have to learn and do by yourself. <br> And you will when you simply finish the task the faculty gives you. Trust me, for every semester we do 5 projects (one for each paper), which will cover the entire thing that the paper covers. We were advised to do it incrementally as the staff proceeds. (But I usually do it at 11th hr :P Nothing beats that thrill ). Once you finish that project, you’ll have a confidence in yourself that you’ve mastered that paper. This is where a CEGian is different from other college guys and this is why we’re seen as the better ones.
              
            <br>  Trust me, there is a guy in my class trying to become batman right now after he did a simple project in Embedded Systems while another fellow is trying to create the next Jarvis :D
              Contacts - One of the great thing I’ll say that I get from this CEG is contacts. Working with the Alumni department for few months earned me so many great contacts than i ever earned in rest of my life (by myself). <br> They will help you a lot if you plan to venture out by yourself and create a start-up. Most of them will be ready to help you incubate with your ideas (if they are truly ideas :P )
              Placements - I promise you that just because you get a seat in CEG doesn’t mean you’ll get a placement (not even in a bulk company). You always have to earn your placement like every other college. Only difference is we have a wide range of companies. 100+ companies come for the placement drive.</p>
